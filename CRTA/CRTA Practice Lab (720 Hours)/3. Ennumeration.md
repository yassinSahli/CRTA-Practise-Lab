Enumerating the machine gives few leads to move forward. We saw this machine has another adapter as well connected in different networks.

Letâ€™s search for browser history / bookmarks, it has been found that the machine has Mozilla Firefox installed.
``#sudo find / -iname "*firefox*" 2>/dev/null``
``#sudo find / -type d -name "*.default-release" 2>/dev/null

We're going to choose this specific directory `**b2rri1qd.default-release**` because it's the **active Firefox profile directory**: the one Firefox is currently using to store:
- **Bookmarks**
- **Browsing history**
- **Cookies**
- **Saved logins**
- **Extensions**
- **Preferences**

``# cd /home/privilege/.mozilla/firefox/b2rri1qd.default-release
``# ls -lha

We will use sqlite3 to access the firefox database as follows

We specifically chose the **`places.sqlite`** file because it is **the central Firefox database that stores both:
- **Bookmarks**
- **Browsing history**

```
#sqlite3 places.sqlite  
sqlite> .tables  
sqlite> select * from moz_bookmarks;
```

--> We found some interesting credentials in the mozilla bookmarks database, divulgating a new network segment: 192.168.98.0/24

--> We have to perform pivoting as 192.168.98.0/24 is not directly accessible from the VPN network. We will utilize **ligolo-ng** for the same.
